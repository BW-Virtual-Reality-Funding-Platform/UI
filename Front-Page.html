        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>Our product derrived from our love for Virtual Reality.
            We knew that VR was going to be the future of media, and we were excited for what it could do.
            After VR became more available to the public, we quickly started to realize, that an 
            overwhelming ammount of people could not use VR because of problems like motion sickness, 
            eye-strian, and many others. We believe that VR should be for everyone, and made to be used 
            by everyone. That is why we have worked countless days and nights to create the VRV2.
            We hope you enjoy it.</p>
